## About

A small project to compare Google Chat and Google Hangouts data exported from Google Takeout.

#### Summary

I started this project as a way to try to match each message from Chat in Hangouts but in the end it there are too many edge cases to handle and it runs way too slow (and isn't worth optimizing). So I settled for a count of the overall messages:

```
$ npx ts-node src/compare-takeout-hangouts-chat.ts ~/Desktop/Takeout/
Found 212709 Hangouts messages
Found 211462 Chat messages
99.41% Hangouts messages in Chat
```

It looks like nearly all the messages from Hangouts were transferred to Chat. (While I no longer care to check at this point, I remember that Hangouts registered separate messages when a call began and ended, whereas for Chat this was just one message, so that alone might account for the difference.)

**However,** images, videos, and other media in Hangouts messages may not have been transferred:

```
$ du -sh Takeout/*
178M    Takeout/Google Chat
21G     Takeout/Google Hangouts
```

#### Why?

> ... some conversations or portions of conversations wonâ€™t automatically migrate from Hangouts to Chat.

> ... download a copy before January 1, 2023, when Hangouts data will be deleted.

#### Usage

1. Export your data

   â“˜ Do this right away as it can take hours before the data download is ready

   1. Go to [https://takeout.google.com/?hl=en](https://takeout.google.com/?hl=en)

      âš  Make sure to use this exact link as it sets the language to English so that the Google Chat timestamp format will be in English, which is what this script expects

   1. Click _Deselect all_ (near the top) then check _Google Chat_ and _Hangouts_

   1. Click _Next step_ (near the bottom) and follow the instructions to create the export

1. Download the data, extract, run this script, e.g.

   ```
   npx ts-node src/compare-takeout-hangouts-chat.ts /path/to/Takeout/
   ```

#### Postmortem

If I had to do this again, I'd probably do something like this:

For each group in Chats:

1. Get the first message
1. Go through all the first messages for each conversation in Hangouts and try to find a match
   - Match timestamp
   - Match text (probably would want an exact match)
1. Then for each subsequent Chat message in the group, try to match each subsequent Hangouts message in order
   - Match timestamp
   - Match just the first part of the text

This would probably allow us to better handle edge cases (line breaks, etc) and it should in theory be much faster. The current script is painfully slow because it tries to match each Chat message with every Hangouts message (out of >200k messages).
